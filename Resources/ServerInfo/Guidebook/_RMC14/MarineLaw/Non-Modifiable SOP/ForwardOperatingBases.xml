[head=3]Forward Operating Bases[/head]

When establishing a Forward Operating Base (FOB), the [color=#007f00]Commander[/color] in charge of an operation should take the minimum precautions to ensure security and defense for stationed Marines and incoming land, air, or sea transports.

- The primary extraction point, such as aircraft landing zones (LZs), are to be reinforced with a minimum line of non-makeshift defenses to prevent immediate enemy breaching.

- FOBs do not have to be placed adjacent to an extraction point, nor does one have to exist at all. However, the extraction point itself must at least be properly defended and guarded.

- Additional combat outposts (COPs) may be established far away from the primary FOB for forward deployment and staging.

- Personnel normally restricted to shipside duties such as doctors and Military Police may be deployed to a FOB freely; however special circumstances or clearances are needed, either via the CO or via the relevant department head, if not conflicting with Marine Law or SOP, to proceed outside the FOB.
