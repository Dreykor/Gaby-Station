[head=3]Third-Party Personnel[/head]

Marines are encouraged to peacefully recover any third-party personnel found in an area of operations and offer them refuge within their ship. All personnel recovered from a combat zone must be searched on arrival and their weapons and unauthorized items secured within the Brig performed by the MP's. They may keep their clothes and tools, provided they are not used for criminal purposes.

Survivors may refuse to answer questions and use their right to remain silent. They may not be punished for this.
Should the civilians deploy to the area of operations again they may request to be given back their gear and an MP must escort them to the dropship to make sure they deploy. Returning Civilians will have to be searched again but may skip the medical check.
They must also be provided with adequate medical care and sustenance. Civilian personnel recovered may be given a temporary junior position in a department or join the USCM should their qualifications allow for it as outlined in the Employment procedure by the [color=#007f00]Commander[/color]. Survivors employed by the USCM may keep their weapons if their position permits them to be armed.

Third-Party Military or Paramilitary forces may be allowed to keep their weaponry, provided their presence is beneficial to the operation.
