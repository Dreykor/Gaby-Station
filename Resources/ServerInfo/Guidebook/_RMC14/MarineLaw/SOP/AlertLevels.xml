[head=3]Authorized Weapons - Code Restrictions[/head]

- Code Green - Authorized Weapons may be carried by deploying marines (any standard issue weapon or weapon ordered from requisitions) and security (non-lethals and sidearms only, not riot gear such as beanbags). Any personnel issued with a weapon upon the start of an operation may retain it, and Commissioned officers may carry sidearms so long as this does not inhibit their standard duties.
Long/Large bladed weapons (Machetes, Axes, Katanas etc.) are treated in the same respect as firearms in terms of carry restrictions.
Civilians are excluded from the right to retain issued weapons, unless they are deploying to a combat zone. Otherwise these weapons must be kept secure in personal quarters or armories.
Personnel who abuse their right to a sidearm can have this revoked by the [color=#007f00]Commander[/color] or, excluding equal or higher ranks, the Chief MP.
The Chief MP or Military Warden may authorise or use Riot Equipment on Code Green so long as this use remains exclusively inside the Brig, for training or defensive purposes.

- Code Blue - All crew are authorized pistols. [color=#cb0000]Military Police[/color] may carry lethal weapons to subdue external threats. [color=#cb0000]Military Police[/head] may use non-lethal riot gear to subdue Marines during a Mutiny or large gatherings of insubordinate personnel. Flashbangs are considered a Riot tool.

- Code Red - No Weapon Restrictions.

- Code Delta - Normally happens when one of the Dropships crashes on the Almayer. You are authorized to use ANY kind of weaponry. The acting [color=#007f00]Commander[/color] may order a general Evacuation, Self Destruction of the ship, or hold the Almayer.

Exception: Firearm use and possession are allowed if you or someone you are responsible for are in immediate, life-threatening danger and the appropriate code-level has not been set.
