[head=2]Ship modifications[/head]
The ship may only be modified with approval from the [color=#007f00]Commander[/color]. The Chief Engineer can also approve changes to the ship, but should it affect a department it requires the Head of Department to approve of it as well. The Military Police must be notified of changes being made prior to them taking effect.

- The [color=#007f00]Commander[/color] has final authority over changes on board the ship.
    
    - Changes to the Brig and CIC are forbidden should those changes compromise security or capability to detain personnel.

- Dismantling elements of the ship to utilise materials for operations is forbidden unless severe enemy contact is confirmed.
    
    - This is defined by enemy contact wherein containment and operational security requires significantly more resources than are immediately to hand. Military Police or other personnel may fax High Command or Provost to contest a decision made by the [color=#007f00]Commander[/color] as to whether the situation requires dismantling parts of the ship.
       
        - A fax is not required should these changes be conducted prior to hostile contact being established.
   
    - Removal of vendors or machines does not constitute illegal modification of the ship unless the act of doing so alters the functionalty or purpose of a specific area.
     
        - Moving medical vendors aboard a dropship does not constitute altering functionality unless it impacts the use of medbay itself.

- A Duty Officer is unable to authorise shipside modifications.
